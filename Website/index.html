			<h2>Your venue awaits...</h2>

			<p>
			Some social networks want to be your stage manager: they put your life on display for audiences both intended (e.g. your friends, your family) and unintended (e.g. advertisers and misbehaving applications).
			</p>

			<p>
			Footlights is different.
			</p>
				
			<p>
			Footlights lets you choose how to present yourself to all of the audiences in your life.
			Share however much&mdash;<i>or however little</i>&mdash;you like, with anybody; this is your show.
			We've built the venue, but this is your production.
			</p>

			<p>
			<i>All the world's a stage</i>... it's time to express yourself.
